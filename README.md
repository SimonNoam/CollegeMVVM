<h1>College System Project (MVVM WPF C#)</h1>
<p>Welcome to the College System project, a MVVM WPF C# application built with Entity Framework.
This project is designed to allow teachers to manage their students and their grades, also to manage teachers courses.</p>
<p>The project is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern,
which allows for separation of concerns and a more maintainable codebase. The project consists of the following main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Model:</strong> This is the data layer of the application and is responsible for interacting with the database using Entity Framework. It includes the entity classes and the context class that represents the database.</li>
  <li><strong>View:</strong> This is the visual layer of the application and is responsible for rendering the UI to the user. It includes the XAML files that define the layout and appearance of the application.</li>
  <li><strong>ViewModel:</strong> This is the logic layer of the application and is responsible for handling the business logic and communication between the model and the view. It includes the class that serves as the intermediary between the model and the view.</li>
</ul>
